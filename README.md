### Description ⌨️

<a id="description"></a>
In this project we will to create a web app with HTML, CSS and JS, where we have next instructions:

2 - Then when the cells appear, you must enter numbers that add up to the value of 100 in both their columns and their rows. link to see preview https://matrix-play.herokuapp.com/

## HTML

Is developed mainly to define our basic structure and start adding basic content such as text, images, video games among others.

The following is very important when working with html.

### Semantics

There are a large number of tags to write our markup, especially since the arrival of HTML5, but it is possible that your page is written using mostly < div > tags, without taking advantage of the semantic options that HTML5 offers us.

Semantics refers to the meaning of words and the meaning of sentences, for example, when we read a coherent text, which uses appropriate words and sentences and which give meaning to what we read.

In the same way, HTML gives us a series of tags with greater meaning, for each part, section, or element of our page, and that, although in practice they do not generate a different result than using a < div > tag as a container for all, they can give our code more meaning, as well as some other advantages.

### Accessibility

What is web accessibility?
Web accessibility means that people with some kind of disability will be able to use the Web. Specifically, when talking about Web accessibility, reference is being made to a Web design that will allow these people to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Web, while providing content. Web accessibility also benefits other people, including older people who have had their skills impaired as a result of age.

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is the style language used to describe the presentation of HTML or XML documents (including various XML-based languages ​​such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how the structured element should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or in other media.

CSS is one of the base languages ​​of the Open Web and has a standardized specification by the W3C. Previously, the development of various parts of the CSS specifications was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the recommendations. You have probably heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never been released as an official version.

Since CSS3, the scope of the specifications increased significantly and the progress of the different CSS modules began to show several differences, which made it more effective to develop and publish recommendations separated by modules. Instead of versioning the CSS specs, the W3C actually captures the latest stable CSS specs.

## JS

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language (scripts) for web pages, it is used in many non-browser environments, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multiparadigm, single-threaded, dynamic programming language with support for object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming (eg, functional programming).
